# Plugin Language Overrides

Place your custom language files in this folder.

To override a specific translation, copy the corresponding language file from the 'defaults' folder into this 'overrides' folder and edit it here.

Changes made directly to files in the 'defaults' folder will not be saved by the plugin.

You can also use this folder to add new languages that do not currently exist.

Please feel free to contribute to new or incomplete languages to the project so that they will be included by default.
